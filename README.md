============

The purpose of this project is to expand on the “Reaching Compliance: SQL Server 2008 Compliance Guide” to more easily handle larger volumes of structured and unstructured data.  The end goal is to gain richer and deeper insight using the latest analytics. To achieve this, we are building a Big Data-to-BI project involving HDInsight (Hadoop on Windows or Azure), SQL Server 2012, SQL Server Analysis Service 2012 Tabular, Integration Services, PowerPivot, and Power View.
